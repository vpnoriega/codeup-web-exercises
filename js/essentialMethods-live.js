// attributes and css things to cover:

//introductory vocab: getters && setters, method chaining
//.html() - GET the HTML contents or SET the HTML contents

//TODO: Let's get the HTML from the element with the ID of "best-seller-cont"

//TODO together: Let's set up a string with HTML to replace this old list with our updated best sellers - FEDORAS have moved into the number one spot!

//TODO: Now, let's get back into that "best-seller-cont" and replace that HTML!

//TODO Together: Can we make a click event that changes "Howell's" to "Marco's" when we click on it? Help me out!

//.css() - get info about a property or change a property

//TODO: Let's see what the width of our "main-content" class is with .css()

//TODO Together: Can you help me? I'd like to set my modal's text to have a cool color :)

//TODO: Let's make an object for us to use with .css(). .

//TODO Together: Nice - now, let's test this out by targeting our h1 with this warning background! Next, let's chain a font color after it

//.addClass() ~ .removeClass() ~ .toggleClass()

//TODO: We've used a lot of bootstrap on the page - let's see what we can use .addClass to do in combination with bootstrap. Let's UPPERCASE that h1 with the shiny red background!

//TODO Together: Can you assist me in removing the "bg-dark" background from our FOOTER?

//TODO: I have a custom css class known as hi-lite - .toggleClass() with a .click() would be a neat way to use it


//Bonus activity:

//TODO: Create a variable to store HTML - use jQuery to get the entire nav element's inner HTML. Console.log your variable to confirm the contents.

//TODO: Remove the class of bg-dark and navbar-dark from the <nav> with jQuery.

//TODO: Add the class of navbar-light and bg-info from the <nav> with jQuery.

//TODO: Finally, create the following - add your own button somewhere on the navbar. Add an event that will toggle the navbar between bg-dark/navbar-dark and bg-info/navbar-light respectively

//TODO: Create your own object with multiple CSS properties you'd like to change. Change whatever element(s) you had in mind with your CSS object and .css()!

//.parent()
//TODO: Let's pop up the tree to the parent (<ol>) and use .css to change the list-style-type
