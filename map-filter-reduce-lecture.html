  //~ * Map * ~

  //TODO Together: Let's see a common approach we might have done in the past: our goal is to increase each element of an array by 1 [element + 1], then get an array back with those values

   // var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
  // var numbersAddOne = [];
  //
  // for (var i=0; i<numbers.length; i +=1){
  //   numbersAddOne.push(numbers[i]+1);
  // }
  // console.log(numbersAddOne);


  //TODO Together: Now, let's achieve the same result with the first part of our lesson: the MAP method~

  // let numbersAddOneMap = numbers.map(function(num){
  //   return num + 1;
  // })
  // console.log(numbersAddOneMap)

  //written above with arrow:
  //let numbersAddOneMap = numbers.map(num=> num +1)

  //TODO Together: Let's get all these restaurant names out of this array of objects with .map()!



  //TODO: Create your own array of (up to 3 and at least 2) restaurant objects building off of the basic list you created during the MapBox exercise (or build one anew!) ~5 mins

 const favoriteRestaurants = [
    {
      name: "Eddie V's Prime Seafood",
      address: "1834 N Loop 1604 W, San Antonio, TX 78248",
      dish: "Shellfish Tower",
      features: ["takeout","fine dining ambiance","reservations accepted","valet parking"]
    },
    {
      name: "Kungfu Noodle",
      address: "6733 Bandera Rd, Leon Valley, TX 78238",
      dish: "lamb noodles",
      features: ["takeout","delivery"]
    },
    {
      name: "La Sorrentina Italian Restaurant",
      address: "3330 Culebra Rd, San Antonio, TX 78228",
      dish: "3 Meat Lasagna",
      features: ["takeout","reservations accepted"]
    }
  ];

  let nameList = favoriteRestaurants.map(function(restaurant){
    return restaurant;
  });

  // console.log(nameList);

  //TODO: Now, having created a personal array of restaurant objects for yourself, use .map() to get your favorite restaurant's names out of that collection, into another array, and out into the console! ~5 mins

  //~ * Filter * ~

  //TODO Together: Once again, let's take a look at the old way we might approach an issue: getting only one type of values out of an array (for example: even numbers only from an array of nums!)

  // var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
  // var evens = [];
  // for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i += 1) {
  //   if (numbers[i] % 2 === 0) {
  //     evens.push(numbers[i]);
  //   }
  // }
  // console.log(evens); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]


  //TODO Together: Now, let's refactor the above using the ES6 .filter() method with the same goal: even numbers only!

  // var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
  //
  // let evens = numbers.filter(function(num){
  //   return num % 2 === 0;
  // });
  // console.log(evens);


  //TODO Together: Using my favoriteRestaurants list, let's filter out all of the non-buffet restaurants

// let hasBuffet =  favoriteRestaurants.filter(function (restaurant){
//   return restaurant.features.includes("buffet");
// })
//   console.log(hasBuffet)

  //TODO: Each one of your restaurant arrays is unique, but, in that array, identify something to filter by - it could be as simple as "well, let me filter out all of the restaurants with names shorter than 8 characters" or get as complicated as you'd like!



  //TODO: Once you've done the above, go ahead and write the necessary code to achieve what you wanted - remember to practice with .filter() and our ES6 verbiage!

  //~ * Reduce * ~

  //Reduce is an interesting animal in and of itself: it's a way to reduce a collection down to, typically, a single value of some kind:

  // .reduce(callBackFunction, initialValue)

  //TODO Together: Let's sum up some numbers with the .reduce() method and a number array!
  let numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];

  let sum = numbers.reduce(function(total,num){
    return total + num;
  }, 0);
  //console.log(sum)


  //TODO Together: Let's take a step a bit deeper with .reduce() - .reduce()'s output can take many forms and shapes. For example, let's say we wanted to have a little Javascript that would count the length of the strings in an array and return that info back to us in an object.

  //For example: ["Codeup", "San Antonio", "Dallas", "Marco", "Cohort", "ES6"] would get us: Object { Codeup: 6, San: 3, Antonio: 7, Dallas: 6, Marco: 5, Cohort: 6, ES6: 3 }

  let stringArr = ["Codeup", "San Antonio", "Dallas", "Marco", "Cohort", "ES6"];

  let strLengthObj = stringArr.reduce(function(object, element){
    object[element] = element.length; // assign the length as a property named element {elementName: elementLength}
    return object;
  }, {}) //going to start with an empty object

  //console.log(strLengthObj);

  //TODO Together: That's pretty wild, eh! Wonder what else we could get up to with .reduce() - how about we make a function and use .reduce() inside of it? We'll write a function named countWords that takes a sentence in a single string. We need to split that sentence into an array and then write a .reduce() that would let us know how many times each word appeared in the string.

  // function countWords(sentence) {
  //   let words = sentence.split(' '); // transform a sentence into an array of words
  //
  //   let wordCountObject = words.reduce(function(wordCounts, word) {
  //     if (typeof wordCounts[word] === 'undefined') {
  //       // if the word is not yet present in our object, set it's value to 1
  //       wordCounts[word] = 1;
  //     } else {
  //       // otherwise increment the existing count
  //       wordCounts[word] += 1;
  //     }
  //     return wordCounts;
  //   }, {}); // start with an empty object
  //
  //   return wordCountObject;
  // }

  let sentence = "Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb";

  //console.log(countWords(sentence));
  // {Mary: 1, had: 1, a: 1, little: 3, lamb: 3}


  //TODO Together: Pretty good, but do we want to count the number of times the comma is involved? If only we had a method that would .filter() - wait! Let's refactor the above function to do just that!

  function countWords(sentence) {
    let words = sentence.split(' '); // transform a sentence into an array of words

    words = words.filter(function(word){
      return word !== ",";
    });

    let wordCountObject = words.reduce(function(wordCounts, word) {
      if (typeof wordCounts[word] === 'undefined') {
        // if the word is not yet present in our object, set it's value to 1
        wordCounts[word] = 1;
      } else {
        // otherwise increment the existing count
        wordCounts[word] += 1;
      }
      return wordCounts;
    }, {}); // start with an empty object

    return wordCountObject;
  }


  //TODO: Let's make a new array of objects to use - make an array of objects [{},{},{}] consisting of a number of family members as objects with their name and ages as properties. Use .reduce() to sum up the age of those family members and see what it is! e.g. [{name: "Thurston Howell III", age: 50}, {name: "William Dean Howells", age: 83}] would be 133 by adding those two age properties together (50 + 83).

  let familyMembers = [
          {name: "Gilbert Noriega II", age: 30},
          {name: "Titus Noriega", age: 8},
          {name: "Harley Noriega", age: 1},
          {name: "Erica Noriega", age: 45},
          {name: "Gracie Noriega", age: 12},
  ]
  // console.log(familyMembers)

  //arrow version:
  // let sumAges = familyMembers.reduce((ages,person) =>{
  //   return ages + person.age;
  // },0);

  //expanded version:
  let sumAges = familyMembers.reduce(function(ages,person){
    return ages + person.age;
  },0);

  //console.log(sumAges)
